# aws-vite-demo
demo for aws / vite bug

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mootook/aws-vite-demo.git # clone the repo

cd aws-vite-demo


# Running node v12.20.1

# dependencies
npm install

# start local server
npm run dev 
```

## Notes

I also ran into a `global is not defined` with aws-amplify v3.3.17.
See `index.html` for solution.
